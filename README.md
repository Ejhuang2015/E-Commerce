# E-Commerce Back End
![GNU License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GNU-blue)

This is a short project based off a starter template designed to practice writing back-end code. This project utilizes Node.js, MySQL, Sequalize, and Express.js to connect to create and connect to a local database. Users are able to utilize an API querying software, such as Postman, to make RESTful routes to perform CRUDdy operations upon an E-Commerce esque database.
